Issues discovered:
- Unit tests need updating to match new cleaning behavior

- 📝 Fixed unit test compilation errors
Issues discovered:
- Role pollution still occurs in some responses ("AI:" and "You:" markers)

### Medium Priority
- **No Request Tracing**: Can't correlate individual requests

### Low Priority
- **No Heartbeat**: Long requests timeout on proxies
- **No Reconnection**: Connection drops require full restart
