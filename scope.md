Perfect. Here’s a **high-level, best-practices build blueprint** you can hand to Claude Code and drive yourself. No low-level steps—just what needs to exist, why, and how you’ll know it’s done.

# SafeChat — MVP Engineering Blueprint (High Level)

## 0) Foundations & Guardrails

**What it is:** Architecture decisions, non-functional targets, and privacy posture that everything else must honor.
**Why it matters:** Prevents scope creep and keeps “local-first privacy” unambiguous.
**Definition of done:**

* Short ADRs documenting runtime, inference engine, API surface, storage, update strategy.
* Explicit targets: cold start, first-token latency, offline guarantee, supported OS matrix.
* Privacy statement: no telemetry, loopback-only, local persistence policy.

---

## 1) Repository & CI Skeleton

**What it is:** Monorepo structure, lint/test tooling, reproducible builds.
**Why it matters:** Enables safe iteration and review.
**Definition of done:**

* Clear top-level folders (desktop app, inference runtime, local API, storage, docs, scripts).
* CI that builds on target OSes, runs lint/typecheck/unit tests, produces unsigned artifacts.
* Dependency health (license allowlist, vulnerability scanning).

---

## 2) Local Inference Runtime (Library, not just a binary)

**What it is:** A thin wrapper around a local LLM backend (e.g., llama.cpp) exposing a clean, async API for load/prepare/generate/stream/cancel.
**Why it matters:** Decouples model execution from UI and HTTP concerns.
**Definition of done:**

* Single interface for text generation with streaming and cancellation.
* Deterministic parameter handling (temperature/top_p/etc.) with sane defaults.
* Model file discovery + integrity checks; clear error surface for OOM/missing/corrupt.

---

## 3) Local OpenAI-Compatible HTTP Layer

**What it is:** Minimal `/v1/chat/completions` bound to `127.0.0.1`, translating requests to the runtime and streaming responses.
**Why it matters:** Interop with existing clients; clean boundary for the desktop app.
**Definition of done:**

* Validates inputs; rejects external bindings; supports streaming response format.
* Health endpoint; basic metrics counters in-process (no remote export).
* Graceful shutdown; backpressure/cancel support.

---

## 4) Storage & Configuration (Local-Only)

**What it is:** Lightweight persistence for conversations and app settings with a privacy toggle.
**Why it matters:** Users expect history, but privacy must be intentional and reversible.
**Definition of done:**

* Schema for conversations/messages/settings with migrations.
* History on/off switch; secure wipe; predictable export/delete behavior.
* No secrets stored in plain text; OS keystore used when applicable.

---

## 5) Desktop Shell (Local-First UX)

**What it is:** A small, responsive app that talks to the local API and never the internet by default.
**Why it matters:** “Feels like ChatGPT” while honoring privacy guarantees.
**Definition of done:**

* Stable chat UI with streaming, retry, error boundaries, and keyboard ergonomics.
* Always-visible status indicator (“Local Mode”) and privacy explainer.
* Settings for model selection/parameters/history; resilient empty/error states.

---

## 6) Packaging, Signing, Updates

**What it is:** Installers, code-signing, and safe auto-update flow.
**Why it matters:** Trust, OS compatibility, and painless delivery.
**Definition of done:**

* Signed installers for target OSes; passes platform gatekeeping.
* Update channel with signed manifests; manual “check for updates” control.
* Disk use transparency (model sizes) and first-run disclosures.

---

## 7) Security & Privacy Hardening

**What it is:** Practical threat model and mitigations aligned to local-first principles.
**Why it matters:** Your differentiation is trust.
**Definition of done:**

* Threat model covering assets, boundaries, and abuse cases (localhost exposure, model tampering, DB leakage).
* Loopback-only networking in release builds; restrictive CSP; minimized permissions.
* No telemetry by default; if opt-in later, counts-only and documented.

---

## 8) Test Strategy & Quality Gates

**What it is:** Automated and manual checks emphasizing correctness, performance, and platform quirks.
**Why it matters:** Confidence without overengineering.
**Definition of done:**

* Unit tests for runtime, request validation, streaming chunking.
* Golden/snapshot tests for protocol output; load test for long chats.
* Manual matrix across OSes: install/first-run/long session/suspend-resume/uninstall.
* Baseline perf measurements recorded for reference hardware.

---

## 9) Release & Documentation

**What it is:** A crisp v0.1.0 with clear constraints and support paths.
**Why it matters:** Sets expectations and reduces support overhead.
**Definition of done:**

* Versioned release with signed artifacts and concise notes (known limitations).
* User docs: install, offline mode, model sizes, privacy FAQ, data controls.
* Developer docs: how to build, where modules live, how to add a model/backend.

---

## 10) Post-MVP Backlog (Prioritized)

**What it is:** Options you can add without compromising the core promise.
**Why it matters:** Guides community asks and prevents premature complexity.
**Candidates:**

* GPU acceleration paths per OS; model manager with checksums/resume.
* Privacy-preserving “cloud burst” (explicit toggle, on-device redaction, no-logs relay).
* Team mode (shared local gateway on a LAN host); import/export of chats.
* Observability (local, opt-in diagnostics bundle; no remote ingestion).

---

## Cross-Cutting Best Practices (Keep Claude focused)

* **Small, stable interfaces.** Treat the runtime, HTTP layer, storage, and UI as separate modules with clear contracts.
* **Fail closed.** If anything is misconfigured, default to local-only and explicit errors.
* **Deterministic defaults.** Lock sampling defaults and document them.
* **Resource awareness.** Surface memory/ctx guidance in UI; handle OOM gracefully.
* **Human-readable errors.** Every error should have an actionable message and a doc link.
* **No hidden egress.** Make network use a compile-time or build-flag decision for release builds.
* **Reproducibility.** Pin toolchains and dependencies; record build metadata in the app “About.”

---

## Milestone-Based “Definitions of Done” (Validation First)

1. **Local runtime emits streamed tokens** (no UI).
2. **Local HTTP layer streams OpenAI-style responses** to a curl/Postman client.
3. **Desktop shell streams from local API**; status indicator reflects local-only.
4. **Installers install; app runs offline out-of-the-box** on target OSes.
5. **Privacy controls verified** (history off/on, wipe), and **no outbound traffic** observed during normal use.

Use this as your north star with Claude: each work item should map to a module, an interface, and a definition of done. If a suggestion drifts into implementation minutiae, steer it back to the **contract, behavior, and acceptance**.
