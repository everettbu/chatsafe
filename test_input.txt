 üéØ Next Step: Fix Streaming Granularity

Right nowAI: , the server supports SSE, but responses come back in a single chunk. For a ChatGPT-like experience (typing effect, responsiveness), you need true incremental flushing.

Why this is next

It directly impacts user experience ‚Äî without granular streaming, the upcoming desktop app will feel ‚Äúlaggy.‚Äù

The rest of your pipeline (engine, server, API contract, golden tests) is already stable.

It‚Äôs a contained task: you don‚Äôt need new models or UI yet, just adjust how tokens are relayed.

What to do at a high level

Update chatsafe-server to forward tokens incrementally from llama-server as they are generated, flushing after each chunk.

Verify Content-Type: text/event-stream responses are streamed, not buffered.

Add per-token/per-phrase flush logic, making sure output conforms to OpenAI‚Äôs SSE chunk format.

Definition of Done

Running curl -N ... "stream": true yields multiple data: events, not one blob.

Golden tests pass with streamed mode (e.g., ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in 2‚Äì3 chunks, ‚ÄúTell me a To optimize streaming performance, consider the following steps: 1. **Optimize video encoding**: Use H.264 or H.265 (HEVC) codecs. 2. **Choose a suitable bitrate**: Balance quality and bandwidth with 5-10 Mbps for HD and 25-50 Mbps for 4K. 3. **Enable adaptive bitrate streaming**: Dynamically adjust bitrate based on viewer demand. 4. **Leverage caching**: Store frequently accessed content in edge locations to reduce latency. 5. **Minimize packet loss**: Use robust error correction and implement forward error correction (FEC). 6. **Monitor performance metrics**: Track FPS, bitrate, latency, and playback errors. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?

üîú After Streaming Is Fixed

DTo provide an incremental response like ChatGPT's typing effect and real-time interaction, we can explore several strategies: 1. **Server-Sent Events with Incremental Updates**: The server sends smaller chunks of text in a continuous stream, allowing the client to render each chunk separately. 2. **WebSockets**: Establish a persistent connection between the client and server, enabling bidirectional communication and real-time updates. 3. **Long Polling**: Periodically request small chunks of data from the server until it's ready with full response, then send them back to the client.
